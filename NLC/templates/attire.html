    <h1> Attire </h1>
    <p>In order to promote a professional atmosphere, BPAâ€™s Board of Trustees has developed the following official dress code policy for the Business Professionals of America National Leadership Conference. Students, advisors and chaperones must follow the dress code. It is recommended that all guests follow established dress code policy.
        Members not dressed in required attire will not be allowed to participate in any session or any competitive event. Members not adhering to the Professional Dress Code will not be allowed on stage.
        Members refused entrance to an event will be given the opportunity to change into appropriate attire immediately and participate/compete in the event. Having changed into appropriate attire, the member will join testing in progress. No additional time will be given for time missed.
        Members also have the right to grieve the issue immediately after being refused entrance. Grievance of the Dress Code policy will not be accepted if not received in writing at Competitive Events headquarters within 15 minutes of the infraction in question.
